 # Bitcoin Digits Date Converter
This repository contains Python code developed for the Bitcoin Digits collection. The software facilitates the conversion of dates to and from a five-digit number. The code includes two functions:

## Version

Current Version: 1.1.0

### Changelog

- **1.0.0** (2023-12-10): Initial release.
Date converter to 5D Bitcoin Digits!
- **1.1.0** (2023-12-10): Output messages chaneges.
- **1.2.0** (2023-03-01): Updated date calculation logic.
  - Changed the date calculation from -1-based to 0-based. The conversion now aligns with the standard where day 0 represents the base date (e.g., 1900-01-01).
  - Updated the calculation in the `convert_five_digit_number_to_date` function accordingly.
  - If you have been using a previous version, please be aware of this change and adjust your calculations accordingly.



You can run this code online using the [Programiz Python Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/). Follow the steps below:

1. Copy and paste the code from the respective Python file (date_converter.py) into the online compiler.
2. Modify the input values according to your requirements.

### Function Parameters

#### `Convert date to 5D Bitcoin Digit number`

- **Input:** `date_string` (string) - The date to convert in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
- **Output:** Returns a five-digit number representing the elapsed days from the base date (1900-01-01).

  ## Example
`date_string` = '1900-01-01'

#### `Convert 5D Bitcion Digit to date`

- **Input:** `five_digit_number` (integer) - The five-digit number to convert.
- **Output:** Returns a date string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' based on the elapsed days from the base date (1900-01-01).

  ## Example
`five_digit_number` = 1 


This updated version specifies the input parameters directly within the code examples for each function.

Note: The adjustment accounts for the 0-based calculation, where day 0 represents the base date (1900-01-01) in the calculations.

Remember to adjust the input values (date_string or five_digit_number) according to your specific use case.
